🧰 Material Access Hub – Inventory & Resource Management System

Material Access Hub is a Python-based command-line inventory system that allows users to view, access, and wishlist materials, while administrators manage stock, pricing, and access records.

This simulation combines object-oriented design with intuitive command-line UI and data tracking, demonstrating efficient data structure use and real-world inventory management practices.

🧠 Project Overview

Material Access Hub is designed to:
- Let users create accounts and securely access inventory
- Enable wishlist tracking for unavailable materials
- Allow admins to view access logs, stock shortages, and modify material data
- Provide visual insights through material availability graphs

This is a hands-on demonstration of **inventory control systems**, **admin-user roles**, and **data management in Python**.
